      "# Setting up the server\n",
      "Although FlowML can be used locally, in hospital environments it makes more sense to run FlowML on a dedicated machine which users can access on the local network.  This allows a more powerful machine to be used and simplifies the distribution of software.  Many hospital machines are locked down, so having users maintain up to date Python installations is infeasble.  In this document, we briefly describe how to setup a server, following the IPython's documentation: '[Running a notebook server](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/public_server.html)' and "
